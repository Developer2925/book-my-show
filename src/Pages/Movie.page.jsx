                        Angela on his own. But when Angela and her friend Katherine, disappear in the woods, only to return three days later
                        with no memory of what happened to them, it unleashes a chain of events that will force Victor to confront the nadir
                        of evil. In his terror and desperation, seek out the only person alive who has witnessed anything like it before:
